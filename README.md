## Solution 

This project presents a smart, scalable energy monitoring and analytics system designed for educational institutions. IoT devices installed in individual laboratories continuously collect energy consumption data and securely transmit it to Google Cloud Firestore in real time. The web-based dashboard allows authenticated users to view daily, weekly, and monthly analytics, filtered by laboratory, enabling precise monitoring and comparison. By integrating Gemini 2.5 Flash, the system converts raw energy data into meaningful summaries, helping users quickly understand usage patterns and inefficiencies. In our opinion, the biggest strength of this solution is its real-time visibility combined with AI-driven insights, making energy management both intelligent and actionable.

## Google Technologies Used
•	Firebase Authentication – Secure user login and UID-based data isolation
•	Google Firestore DB – Real-time NoSQL database for storing energy records, lab metadata, and timestamps
•	Firebase Hosting – Deployment of the whole application
•	Firebase Web SDK – Frontend data access and real-time querying
•	Firestore REST API – Direct data ingestion from ESP32 devices

## Google AI Tools Integrated
•	Gemini 2.5 Flash – Used for fast, cost-efficient AI summarization of energy consumption trends and insights for users.
